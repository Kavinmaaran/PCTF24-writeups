The flag is very well hidden but you can find it as long as you listen to my clues carefully. Now, I shall give you the first clue.
A plaintext is encrypted using AES-128 in CBC mode. 
  > plaintext = "there aren't any RED herrings in this challenge. Do IT carefully."
Modify the IV so that the same ciphertext now decrypts to 
  > "sadly, there are RED herrings in this challenge. Do IT carefully."
